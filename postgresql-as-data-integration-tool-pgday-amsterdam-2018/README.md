# PostgreSQL As Data Integration Tool

Instead of using ETL Tools, which consume tons of memory on their own system, you will learn how to do ETL jobs directly in and with a database.
PostgreSQL Management of External Data ([SQL/MED](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38643)) is also known as Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW). With FDW, there is nearly no limit of external data, that you could use directly inside a PostgreSQL database.
