# One Database to Rule â€˜em all
## Talk at [Buzzwords Berlin 2017](https://berlinbuzzwords.de/17/)
## [Abstract](https://berlinbuzzwords.de/17/session/one-database-rule-em-all)
Instead of using ETL Tools, which consume tons of memory on their own system, you will learn how to do ETL jobs directly in and with a database: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

PostgreSQL Management of External Data ([SQL/MED](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38643)) is also known as Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW). With FDW, there is nearly no limit of external data, that you could use directly inside a PostgreSQL database.

This talk will show you how to use them with examples accessing several data sources.
